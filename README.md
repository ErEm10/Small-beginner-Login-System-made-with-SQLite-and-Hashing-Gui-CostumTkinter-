##  About the Project
This is a small beginner project I built to improve my programming skills and understanding of:
- GUI development with **CustomTkinter**
- Data handling using **SQLite**
- Password **Hashing (SHA256)** for secure storage

Iâ€™m a student who loves programming and learning new technologies â€”  
and Iâ€™m sharing my progress here to track how I grow as a developer ðŸ’»âœ¨
